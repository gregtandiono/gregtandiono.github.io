7 Years of Development experience from the painful days of PHP to the light of current technologies. 
Worked as a photoshop jocky, poster cruncher, image-tracer,
wordpress developer (those days are over, I promise),
and full-stack (from design to devops).
I prefer to work on the client-side, but if need be, I can be the polyglot.

I currently work at [Farm At Hand](http://www.farmathand.com) as a polyglot developer.
I have worked at [Ogilvy & Mather Singapore](http://www.ogilvy.com),
[Red Bull Indonesia (Kratingdeng)](http://www.kratingdaeng.co.id/), and various agencies in South East Asia,

I have no formal training in development, I am self-taught.
I have a BA in **music** and also in **journalism**.
I earned my skills through experience, my sponge-like brain,
and my excellent googling skills.

Interested in working with me or collaborate on an open-source project?
