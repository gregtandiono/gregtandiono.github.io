# Personal Website

My personal website hosted with github

**notes:**

I have intentionally left the `bower_components` out of the `.gitignore`
file, because I can't exactly tell git to run `bower install` when I
deploy to *github pages* everything else is compiled nicely.

**future plans:**

- [ ] Create a grunt task to compile all bower dependencies (so I can
    just check that one in instead of the `bower_components` directory)
- [ ] Host the site somewhere else (digital ocean would be my first choice)
- [ ] Host a blog on a different git project (metalsmith/wintersmith)
